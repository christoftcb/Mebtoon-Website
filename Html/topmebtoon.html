                <h1> My Hero Academia</h1>
                   <p >One day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is not fair. 
                    Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as "quirks," 
                    which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. 
                    Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. 
                    Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, 
                    Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High. However, everything changes after a 
                    chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, 
                    the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. 
                    Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, 
                    gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet.</p>

                <h1> Kimetsu No Yaiba</h1>
                <br>
                   <p>The story takes place in Taish≈ç-era Japan, where a secret society,known as 
                    the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. 
                    The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them 
                    with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, 
                    powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art ", and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're
                     decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from Wisteria flowers, 
                     or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing 
                     techniques, known as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance. 
                     This helps increase their chances fighting against demons.</p>

                   <p >The beginning of the story begins with a young man named Saitama who has a unique hobby since childhood, namely being a hero.
                    To realize his dream, Saitama worked hard by continuing to practice and study non-stop for three years.
                    During the process of reaching the peak of his dreams, Saitama did many things and he was willing to lose his hair to change his look to be different.
                    As time goes by, Saitama's strength is very strong, he is even able to fight many enemies with just one hit.
                    His strength seemed so incomparable that no one was able to resist.</p>

                    However, there is a sixth player who is included in Kiseki No Sedai but whose whereabouts are unknown. The sixth player's name is Kuroko Tetsuya who is referred to as a shadow.
                    
                    All Kiseki No Sedai players including Kuroko decided not to go to the same school when entering high school. The five players enter high school who are strong in basketball.
                    
                    Kuroko actually goes to Seirin High School which has a basketball club that has only been around for one year. Kuroko there met Kagami Taiga who was both in the 1st grade of high school but had a large stature and was from the United States.
                    
                    Kuroko and Kagami eventually join the Seirin High School Basketball club.</p>

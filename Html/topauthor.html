            <br>
                <p>Masashi Kishimoto is a Japanese manga artist, best known for creating the popular manga series ‘Naruto.’ ‘Naruto’ has gone down in history as one of the most-loved manga in the world. Masashi was born in Okayama, Japan, and was a huge fan of anime and manga since his elementary school days. He was a massive fan of the ‘Dragon Ball’ manga and the series. Its creator, Akira Toriyama, became one of his main inspirations to become a manga artist. Masashi was also inspired by the artistic brilliance of the animated film ‘Akira’ and ‘Ghost in the Shell.’ He decided to study arts in university. While in college, he started submitting his works to various magazines, and his first successful manga, the pilot for ‘Karakuri,’ was submitted to ‘Shueisha’ in 1995. He earned several honors for his work. However, this was followed by a vastly unsuccessful phase. In 1997, his one-shot version of ‘Naruto’ was published. The serialized version of ‘Naruto’ premiered in 1999. It ended in 2014 after being in circulation for 15 years. Having sold millions of copies in Japan and other countries, it became one of the most successful manga of all time. Several other versions of ‘Naruto’ were written in the following years, making Masashi one of the most celebrated manga artists of all time.
